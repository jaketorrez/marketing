# African Marketplace: Marketing Page
## UI Developed by Jake Torres
    African Marketplace aims to help poor small business owners in Africa to escape poverty. With a strong emphasis on empowering female business owners, the app provides a platform for disenfranchised African entrepreneurs to manage a variety of important activities, including:
- Posting items for customers to buy
- Staying up-to-date on the market value of products like theirs
- Networking and collaborating with other local business owners in their area
    This repo is the home of the marketing portion of the app. It includes responsive home and about pages.
